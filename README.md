# OpenAssetIO

An open-source interoperability standard for tools and content
management systems used in media production.

OpenAssetIO defines a common set of interactions between a host of the
API (eg: a Digital Content Creation tool or pipeline script) and an
Asset Management System.

It aims to reduce the integration effort and maintenance overhead of
modern CGI pipelines, and pioneer new, standardized asset-centric
workflows in post-production tooling.

OpenAssetIO enabled tools and asset management systems can freely
communicate with each other, without needing to know any specifics of
their respective implementations.

The API has no inherent functionality. It exists as a bridge - at the
boundary between a process that consumes or produces data (the host),
and the systems that provide data coordination and version management
functionality.

## Scope

The API covers the following areas:

- Resolution of asset references (URIs) into a dictionary of data,
  grouped into one or more "traits" (providing URLs for access, and
  other asset data).
- Publishing data for file-based and non-file-based assets.
- Discovery and registration of related assets.
- Replacement/augmentation of in-application UI elements such as
  browsers and other panels/controls.

The API, by design, does not:

- Define any standardized data structures for the storage or
  description of assets or asset hierarchies.
- Dictate any aspect of how an asset management system operates,
  organizes, locates or manages asset data and versions.

The API builds upon the production-tested [Katana Asset API](https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.0/Content/tg/asset_management_system_plugin_api/asset_management_system.html),
addressing several common integration challenges and adding support
for a wider range of asset types and publishing workflows.

## Project status

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6046/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6046)

> **Important:** The project is currently in early beta stage and is
> subject to change. Do not deploy the API in production critical
> situations without careful thought.

We are currently working towards a v1.0.0 release. We are in the process
of porting the core API from Python to C/C++.

The code is presented here in its current form to facilitate discussion
and early-adopter testing. We actively encourage engagement in the
[discussion](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/discussions)
and to give feedback on current [Issues](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues)
and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/pulls).

We have been making some structural changes whilst migrating to this
repository and removing some spurious/legacy concepts. There may well
be some rough edges so bear with us whilst we get things ship-shape.

Please see the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenAssetIO/projects/1)
for work in progress, as well as up-coming topics.

### TODO list

- Complete core C/C++ API work
- Define Traits for post-production in the [OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation)
  repository
- [AR2.0](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/668045551.html) interop
  investigations

## Background

Within the Media and Entertainment sector, digital content (such as
images, models and editorial data) is usually managed by a central
catalog. This catalog is commonly known as an "Asset Management System",
and forms a singular source of truth for a project.

OpenAssetIO provides an abstraction layer that generalizes the dialog
between a 'host' (eg. a Digital Content Creation application such as
Maya&reg; or Nuke) and one of these systems - a 'manager' (eg. ShotGrid,
ftrack or other proprietary systems).

This project first began in 2013, taking inspiration from the production
tested [Katana Asset API](https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.0/Content/tg/asset_management_system_plugin_api/asset_management_system.html)
to make it more suitable for a wider variety of uses. Modern pipelines
are incredibly nuanced. Finding a common framework that brings value in
this space is challenging to say the least. Prototypes built during the
development of `OpenAssetIO` over the last few years have demonstrated
significant developer and artist value.

We hope the API forms a practical starting point that addresses many
real-world use cases, and as an industry, we can evolve the standard
over time to support any additional requirements. We are currently
investigating the relationship with [Ar 2.0](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/668045551.html),
which appears to overlap with a subset of `OpenAssetIO`s concerns.

## Getting started

### Installation

The OpenAssetIO codebase is available as a git repository on GitHub

```shell
git clone git@github.com:OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO
```

### System requirements

Linux is currently the only fully tested platform. Support
for other platforms is the subject of ongoing work.

#### Quick start: Using the ASWF Docker image

The Academy Software Foundation maintains a set of VFX Reference
Platform compatible [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images [here](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker).

The CY22 image contains all dependencies currently required for building
OpenAssetIO. For example, to build and install the C/C++ component of
OpenAssetIO (by default  to a `dist` directory under the build
directory)
via a container, from the repository root run

```shell
docker run -v `pwd`:/src aswf/ci-base:2022.2 bash -c '
  cd /src && \
  cmake -S . -B build && \
  cmake --build build --target openassetio-python-py-install'
```

#### Other build methods

For detailed instructions see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
